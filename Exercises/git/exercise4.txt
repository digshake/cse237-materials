Using the same partner as before:

1. Make sure you are on the same branch, and that you have both pulled so that your repositories are up to date.

2. You should both make a change to the same file. The file should now be different on each of your computers. Commit your change.

3. One of you should push your change. 

4. The other person should pull the change that was pushed. This will result in a conflict. Edit the file to reconcile the conflict, then commit and push the change.

5. Pull the change so that both copies are once again the same.
