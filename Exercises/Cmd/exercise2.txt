Make a directory called "test"

Within the test directory make directories called "first" and "second"

Copy /bin/bash into "first"

Copy another file of your choice into "second"

Open the normal file browser on your computer (Finder on a mac). 
Locate the test directory and examine the contents. 
Does it match up with what you would expect?

Remove all of the files and directories that you created.
