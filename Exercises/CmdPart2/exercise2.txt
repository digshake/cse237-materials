Grep practice

There's a file on Canvas called "addresses.txt"

Download this file and navigate to the directory that contains that file on the command line.

1. Pull the complete entries (Name, Phone Number, Address) of all the individuals who are from Illinois
2. Pull the complete entries of all the individuals with the phone number with area code 772 (keep in
mind area code needs to be the first three digits of the phone number).
3. Count the number of people are from Kentucky using grep only (Do not manually count!)
4. Pull the complete entries from anyone who is from North/South Carolina or Virginia using one grep
command.
